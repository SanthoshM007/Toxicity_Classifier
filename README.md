# Toxicity Classifier

The Toxicity Detection Classifier is a machine learning project that classifies text as either "Toxic" or "Non-Toxic." It utilizes a pre-trained Multinomial Naive Bayes model and TfidfVectorizer for text processing. The project features a FastAPI backend for serving predictions and a Streamlit frontend for user interaction. Users can input text through the web interface or via API requests. The application aims to provide insights into the toxicity of user-generated content in real-time.

# Tech Stack
FastAPI: For building the REST API.
Streamlit: For creating a web application interface.
scikit-learn: For machine learning functionalities.
NumPy: For numerical computations.
Pickle: For model serialization and deserialization.
Multinomial: Naive Bayes model
