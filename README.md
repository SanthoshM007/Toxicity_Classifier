# Toxicity Classifier

This project consists of a toxicity detection classifier implemented using FastAPI and Streamlit. It classifies input text as either "Toxic" or "Non-Toxic" based on a pre-trained model.


# Tech Stack
FastAPI: For building the REST API.
Streamlit: For creating a web application interface.
scikit-learn: For machine learning functionalities.
NumPy: For numerical computations.
Pickle: For model serialization and deserialization.
Multinomial: Naive Bayes model
